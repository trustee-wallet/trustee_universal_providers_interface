# Trustee Universal Interface

## Introduction

Each method must be implemented as a separate API endpoint.

![General](https://github.com/trustee-wallet/trustee_universal_providers_interface/blob/master/img/General.png)

## GET: Exchange ways list

You must implement an endpoint that will return a list of exchange ways.

Requirements for the exchange ways list are the same as for exchanger monitors.

Here is an [example of documentation](https://www.bestchange.com/wiki/rates.html) on how to properly create a exchange ways list.

```xml
<rates>
    <item>
        <from>XMR</from>
        <to>QWRUB</to>
        <in>1.00000000</in>
        <out>21284.32320000</out>
        <amount>851556.18</amount>
        <fromfee>0.000000 XMR</fromfee>
        <tofee>0.00 RUB</tofee>
        <minamount>0.039796 XMR</minamount>
        <maxamount>3.757901 XMR</maxamount>
    </item>
    <item>
        <from>LTC</from>
        <to>CARDRUB</to>
        <in>1.00000000</in>
        <out>13596.07014551</out>
        <amount>851556.18</amount>
        <fromfee>0.000000 LTC</fromfee>
        <tofee>0.00 RUB</tofee>
        <minamount>0.552109 LTC</minamount>
        <maxamount>3.330972 LTC</maxamount>
    </item>
</rates>
```

If you need to specify a fixed and percentage fee together, then you can do this as follows:

```xml
<fromfee>5 UAH</fromfee>
<fromfee>1.5 %</fromfee>
```

If you need to specify a rate type, then you can do this as follows. The interface supports 2 rate types: **FLOATING** and **FIXED** (**FLOATING** by default).

```xml
<ratetype>FLOATING</ratetype>
```

Trustee support tokens of different networks. As an optional parameter, you can specify a currency network code.

```xml
<fromnetwork>ETH</fromnetwork>
<tonetwork>BSC</tonetwork>
```

Universal interface supports the following networks:

| Network code |  Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **ETH** | Ethereum. |
| **BSC**  | Binance Smart Chain. |
| **TRX** | Tron. |
| **SOL** | Solana. |
| **OMNI** | Bitcoin Omni. |

Also, users can add various tokens if there are no default support. In this case, Trustee will try to find exchange ways of such tokens in you. In order to implement the search for such tokens you can add the following optional parameters. You can specify only one of them or both.

```xml
<fromcontract>0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7</fromcontract>
<tocontract>0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984</tocontract>
```

## Authentication

Methods **estimate amount**, **create order**, **check order** and **cancel order** must be authenticated.

Authentication parameters are transmitted in **Headers**.

The **request based auth headers** are transmitted by Trustee and should be checked on the exchanger side. The **response based auth headers** are transmitted by exchanger and should be checked on the Trustee side.

The signature for the request and response should be generated by the same logic.

![Auth](https://github.com/trustee-wallet/trustee_universal_providers_interface/blob/master/img/Auth.png)

An [example](https://github.com/trustee-wallet/trustee_universal_providers_interface/blob/master/signature.js) of generating a signature.

API keys are generated once by any side (Trustee or exchanger) and then share them to the other side.

| Header | Type | Required |  Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **trustee-public-key** | String  | optional | Partner's public key. |
| **trustee-timestamp**  | String | required | Timestamp that was used to generate the signature. |
| **trustee-signature** | String | required | Signature. |
| **trustee-env** | String | optional | The environment where a request is sent *(LOCAL, DEV or PROD)*. |

You can check the signature using this endpoint:

> first you need to share a API keys with the Trustee

`
https://testapiv3.trustee.deals/trustee-universal/check-signature
`

### Request body:

body that will be used to generate signature.

### Request headers:

| Header | Type | Required |  Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **trustee-public-key** | String  | required | Partner's public key. |
| **trustee-timestamp**  | String | required | Timestamp which will be used to generate signature. |

### Response body:

| Parameter | Type |  Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **parametersSequence** | String  | Sequence of parameters for **initString**. |
| **initString**  | String | A string that will be used to generate a signature. |
| **signature**  | String | Signature for request body. |

### Response headers:

| Header | Type | Required |  Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **trustee-timestamp** | String  | required | Timestamp which was used to generate a response signature. |
| **trustee-signature**  | String | required | Signature for response body. |

With the help of **response based auth headers**, you can check the generation of response signature. It is identical to the request signature process.

### Example:

### Response body:

| Parameter | Type | Required |  Description | Example
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **from** | String  | required | Code for **from** currency. Same as in the exchange ways list. | CARDRUB |

#### Calculation example:

Trustee fee is 0.5%.

0.5% from 6500 = 32.5 RUB (**extraFromFee**)

6500 RUB – 32.5 RUB = 6467.5 RUB * 3079761.9 (**fromRate**) = 0.0021 BTC

0.0021 BTC – 0.0005 BTC (**toFee**) = 0.0016 BTC (**toAmount**).
